# Big-data-project
This repository is maintained to document my big data analytics project.


The idea of the project is based on - C. Dabas, P. Kaur, N. Gulati and M. Tilak, "Analysis of Comments on Youtube Videos using Hadoop," 2019 Fifth International Conference on Image InformationProcessing (ICIIP), Shimla, India, 2019, pp. 353-358, doi:10.1109/ICIIP47207.2019.8985907.


The project consists of three tasks :
1. **Data visualization**
2. **Sentiment analysis with Naive Bayes classifier**
3. **Content based recommender system**

The data for task 2 and task 3 can be obtained as follows :
- For task 2, [Kaggle Trending YouTube Video Statistics and Comments dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube) was used
- The steps followed for collecting data for recommeder system is explained in **data collection** under task 3

## Task 1 - Data visualization 
- Tableau has been used for viz and the link for workbook is also provided
- The data from 2 countries - US and GB only has been used
- Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from the plots which can be found under the category **Inferences**
